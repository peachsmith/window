# Building on MacOS

This directory contains the Makefile for macOS.
<br/>
The current version of the Makefile expects the SDL2 libraries (SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_mixer) to be installed as frameworks in `/Library/Frameworks`.
<br/>
<br/>
The old Makefile, named `Makefile-old` expects the SDL2 libraries to be built from source and installed in directories specified by environment variables.
<br/>
The current Makefile is the recommended way of building on MacOS.
